# Appzio UI Kit
Purpose of Appzio UI Kit is to help develop applications with a more unified look-and-feel and speed up development radically by reducing the time needed for styling views and components. 

Full set of Appzio UI Kit components will be available starting from November 2018 and it includes both individual components and entire views with basic logic already in place. 

Components are accessed same way than any other component and depending on the component they take different parameters.

For example:
```
$this->uiKitTextHeader('{#my_title#}');
```

All UI Kit styles can be overriden with your style modifications either by providing overriding style code, or applying a custom style name.

You can download Appzio UI Kit as a Sketch file from:
https://docs.appzio.com/uikit/

Appzio UI Kit is released with the Apache 2.0 public license, which means that you can use the UI Kit Sketch file also without Appzio.
