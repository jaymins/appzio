Sami;19;Single;Marriage;Other;Veg;Smoke;Yes;Virgo;Honesty and openness are the most important qualities in a relationship. I will be honest with you, if you will be honest with me. In the spirit of openness and honesty, I think it's only fair to tell you that I'm looking for an open relationship. I will never lie to you about my other lovers. In fact, I'll start now to show you how sincere I am. Last week, I had a very sensuous encounter with a most funny man from Inverness. These are the kind of truths I will tell you if we enter into a relationship.
Aadhira;20;Single;Dating;Muslim;Non-veg;Vape;Yes;Aquarius;I am not one of those fake people who pretends not to notice their own qualities. My ankles and fingernails are top notch. These gems of honesty are just part of the modest person I am.

Kadambari;33;Single;Friendship;Hindu;Veg;Smoke;No;Aries;I work as a cleaner, helping women. This allows me to exercise my skills: public speaking and programming computers. My job once caused me to encounter Ronald McDonald, yet still men treat me like junk. It's just not on.

Kaishori;18;Single;Marriage;Christian;Veg;None;Yes;Capricorn;I work as a doctor, helping the public. This allows me to exercise my skills: bravery and intelligence. My idol is Walter Raleigh.

I once saw Walter Raleigh at a petrol station, so I feel we have a deep connection - almost spiritual, like the mist on an autumn day, or similar.
Kajal, Kajol;19;Single;Dating;Sikh;Non-veg;None;Yes;Gemini;I work as a hairdresser, helping children. This allows me to exercise my skills: saving lives and cutting hair.
