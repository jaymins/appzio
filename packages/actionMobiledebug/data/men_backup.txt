GirlsRHardToGet40;19;Single;Marriage;Other;Veg;Smoke;Yes;Virgo;Honesty and openness are the most important qualities in a relationship. I will be honest with you, if you will be honest with me. In the spirit of openness and honesty, I think it's only fair to tell you that I'm looking for an open relationship. I will never lie to you about my other lovers. In fact, I'll start now to show you how sincere I am. Last week, I had a very sensuous encounter with a most funny man from Inverness. These are the kind of truths I will tell you if we enter into a relationship.
LetsSkipNJump;20;Single;Dating;Muslim;Non-veg;Vape;Yes;Aquarius;I am not one of those fake people who pretends not to notice their own qualities. My ankles and fingernails are top notch. These gems of honesty are just part of the modest person I am.

MySeptumIsPierced35;33;Single;Friendship;Hindu;Veg;Smoke;No;Aries;I work as a cleaner, helping women. This allows me to exercise my skills: public speaking and programming computers. My job once caused me to encounter Ronald McDonald, yet still men treat me like junk. It's just not on.
NoDramaPlz;34;Single;Long-Term Relationship;Hindu;Non-veg;Vape;No;Cancer;I work as a computer programmer, helping old people. This allows me to exercise my skills: intelligence and selling kippers.
