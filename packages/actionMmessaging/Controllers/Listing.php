<?php

/**
 * This example shows a simple registration form. Usually this action would be used in conjuction with
 * Mobilelogin action, which provides login and logout functionalities.
 *
 * Default controller for your action. If no other route is defined, the action will default to this controller
 * and its default method actionDefault() which must always be defined.
 *
 * In more complex actions, you would include different controller for different modes or phases. Organizing
 * the code for different controllers will help you keep the code more organized and easier to understand and
 * reuse.
 *
 * Unless controller has $this->no_output set to true, it should always return the view file name. Data from
 * the controller to view is passed as a second part of the return array.
 *
 * Theme's controller extends this file, so usually you would define the functions as public so that they can
 * be overriden by the theme controller.
